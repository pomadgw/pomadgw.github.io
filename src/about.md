This is the blog by Rian (aka pomadgw, that's me!), a software engineer working as
front end developer in Jakarta (well, office is Jakarta, currently doing
remote work from home at Bogor.) I have worked in front end side for at least four years.

Obviously I know JavaScript, and I primarily work using Vue.
I have interest in other JS frameworks, such as Svelte and React.

I also know Ruby, Python, and currently learning how to code in Rust and Kotlin.

I can speak Indonesian and English, and currently learning Japanese.
I also plan to learn Arabic and German.
