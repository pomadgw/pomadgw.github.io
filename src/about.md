This is the blog by Rian (aka pomadgw, that's me!), a software engineer working as
front end developer in Jakarta (well, the office is Jakarta, currently doing
remote work from home at Bogor.) I have worked in the front-end side since 2017.

I know JavaScript, primarily work using React, and have experience using Vue.
I have an interest in other JS frameworks, such as Svelte.

I also know Ruby and Python and am currently learning to code in Rust, Go, and Kotlin.

I can speak Indonesian and English, and currently learning Japanese.
I also plan to learn Arabic and German.
