description: Post a post again after a long time!
---

Oh my god, it has been a long time to post here. The last post was 5 years ago!
Such a long time. At the time, I was a student, now I am a front-end developer.
I would like to share something here, about front-end, about other that front end,
and even about anything but programming.

<!-- more -->

Let's start this with my confession: this blog was initally a Jekyll-based blog
served as Github Page. But now that I am much more comfortable with JavaScript,
and particularly with Vue framework, so why not recreate this blog?

This new blog is now using [Vuepress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/). This site is pretty much
"under (eternal) construction", when I will make a little tweak whenever I want (or when I remember ;p ).

By the way, a lot of thing has changed. Now, I already entered the second year of working
remotely from home. Why? You know, [a certain virus has spread throughout the world](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19_pandemic).
I honestly miss going outside, riding the train. But well, it cannot be helped.

Anyway, I want to try writing something here, probably at least once a month. I am always too shy to share anything,
but I think that need to change.

Anyway, hello again.
